      <h1>About this website</h1>
      <p>
        I am especially proud of this site as it's something that I put lots of
        effort into - especially making it mobile friendly. Keeping it small and
        simple was one of my main priorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had previously set up the hosting for this website the hard way, using
        an EC2 instance based in Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ which I manually configured with
        <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">HTTPD</a>, renewing the SSL
        certificate myself manually in order to enable HTTPS. Fun stuff! I leant
        a lot setting that up, however I have since changed the hosting solution
        to a more simple deployment with less maintainance required.

      <h2>Future updates</h2>
      <p>
        At some point, I will get around to upgrading the site to use Hugo
        templating, likely when it becomes too much hassle to manually update
        the html myself. I'm reluctant to use something like wordpress as I
        don't want to abstract <i>too</i> much away.

        The site itself is written in pure HTML and CSS, and was designed to be
        lightweight, simple, and minimal. If you want to take a look at the raw
        HTML yourself, the site is publicly available on my github
        <a href="https://github.com/charlesdevelops/dotcom"> here</a>.
