      <h3>A CLI application to store ip addresses in the command line</h3>

        ipster is a CLI application that stores IP addresses and their
        associated details in the terminal for quick access. It allows the user
        to easily add, list, remove, and generate SSH commands for saved IP
        addresses, saving generated commands to the users clipboard.

        I came up with the idea when repeatedly needing to write out the same
        SSH commands. I thought it would be a good project to both solve a
        problem I have, as well as learn Go at the same time. Overall, I'm happy
        with the result, given that the project is in a useable state and I
        learnt a lot about Go. It took me roughly two weeks between starting to
        learn the basics in Go to having finished this project.

      <h2>Other possible features</h2>
      <p>
        There a few things I may add in the future to this project, but I am
        fairly happy with how it is currently. Most of the features I would add
        are cosmetic, such as adding colour to the programs outputs, or adding a
        fancy text art logo like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
         _            __           
        (_)___  _____/ /____  _____
       / / __ \/ ___/ __/ _ \/ ___/
      / / /_/ (__  ) /_/  __/ /    
     /_/ .___/____/\__/\___/_/     
      /_/                          
    </pre
      >
      <p>
        But these aren't particularly neccessary to the programs functionality
        and may detract from its simplicity.
