      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      My main hobby is playing chess - if you are interested feel free to check
      out my chesscom
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/insights/charles#overview">insights</a>
      or my
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/stats/live/rapid/charles">current rating</a
      >. Outside of chess I spend my time reading, travelling (when I can), and
      hanging out with my dog Boris, pictured above. I also really like coffee
      ‚òïÔ∏è.

        <h2>This website!</h2>
        I am especially proud of this site as it's something that I have put
        lots of effort into - especially making it mobile friendly. It loads
        super fast despite being hosted on a single T4g server in Singapore üá∏üá¨,
        since the page size itself is tiny. It's even sent over an encrypted
        connection - something that took me quite a while to figure out. Check
        out that üîí HTTPS icon in your browser! Plus I learnt all the ins and
        outs that come with manually setting up webhosting on a linux server,
        which is why theres a little note about it at the bottom of my site.
        <h3>Site specs:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Hosted on a T4g instance, which is currently
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#t4g-instances"> free</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Served using <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTPD</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            HTTPS enabled, certified via the
            <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"> LetsEncrypt</a> CA
          </li>
          <li>Written in HTML and CSS</li>

      <h2>A greener EV (Upcoming)</h2>
      By monitoring how much electricity a solar panel system generates, I aim
      to be able to dynamically change the charge rate of a linked electric
      vehicle in order to charge via 100% natural energy, regularly altering its
      charging rate in order to not draw any power from the main grid. The
      benefits of this include the direct cost savings via reduced main
      electricity grid usage, and indirectly a lower carbon footprint on the
      environment via consumption of purely "green" electricity.
