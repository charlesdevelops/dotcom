      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      My main hobby is playing chess - if you are interested feel free to check
      out my chesscom
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/insights/charles#overview">insights</a>
      or my
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/stats/live/rapid/charles">current rating</a
      >. Outside of chess I spend my time reading, listening to music,
      travelling (when I can), and hanging out with my dog Boris, pictured
      above. I also like coffee ‚òïÔ∏è.

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>
        Most of my projects are done to learn new skills, as I personally learn
        best by doing things instead of reading about them or watching videos.

        <h2>This website</h2>
        <p>
          A pet project which originally was hosted on a linux webserver in the
          effort of teaching myself how to maintain a site and get comfortable
          with technologies such as SSL, DNS, and EC2. I've since moved it to
          Cloudflare Pages.

      <div>
        <h2>ipster</h2>
        <p>
          A CLI application I wrote in Go. The aim was to target a pain point in
          my workflow, helping to semi-automate everyday tasks. Thanks to the
          <a href="https://github.com/spf13/cobra">cobra</a> framework, it's
          quite robust!

        <h2>Other upcoming projects</h2>
        I have a bunch of ideas I'm looking to work on over the course of the
        year in my free time, with some smaller projects already on my github.
        I'll update this site as I work on them!
