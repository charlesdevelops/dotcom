      <h1>About me</h1>
      I was born in London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ but now live in Perth ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º, and currently I'm
      studying Computer Science, Finance, and Data Science at
      <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au">UWA</a>. Right now, I am also working
      full time as a Solutions Architect at
      <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>, where I
      previously interned.

      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      My main hobby is playing chess - if you are interested feel free to check
      out my chess.com
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/insights/charles#overview">insights</a>
      or my
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/stats/live/rapid/charles">current rating</a
      >. Outside of chess I spend my time reading, listening to music, language
      learning, travelling (when I can), and hanging out with my dog Boris,
      pictured above.

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>
        Most of my projects are done to learn new skills, as I personally learn
        best by doing things instead of reading about them or watching videos.

        <h2>This website</h2>
        <p>
          A pet project which originally was hosted on a linux webserver in the
          effort of teaching myself how to maintain a site and get comfortable
          with technologies such as SSL, DNS, and EC2. I've since moved it to
          Cloudflare Pages.

        <h2>ipster</h2>
        <p>
          A CLI application I wrote in Go. The aim was to target a pain point in
          my workflow, helping to semi-automate everyday tasks. Thanks to the
          <a href="https://github.com/spf13/cobra">cobra</a> framework, it's
          quite robust!
