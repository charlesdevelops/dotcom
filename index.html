      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      My main hobby is playing chess - if you are interested feel free to check
      out my chesscom
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/insights/charles#overview">insights</a>
      or my
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/stats/live/rapid/charles">current rating</a
      >. Outside of chess I spend my time reading, travelling (when I can), and
      hanging out with my dog Boris. I also really like ☕️.

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <h2>This website!</h2>
      I am especially proud of this site as it's something that I have put a lot
      of effort into. It loads super fast despite being hosted on a single
      server in Singapore 🇸🇬, since the page itself is tiny. It's even sent over
      an encrypted connection - something that took me quite a while to figure
      out. Check out that 🔒 HTTPS icon in your browser! Plus I learnt all the
      ins and outs that come with manually setting up webhosting on a linux
      server, which is why there's a little note about it hidden at the bottom.
      <h2>(coming soon) An actually green EV</h2>
      By monitoring how much electricity our solar panels generate, I hope to be
      able to charge our tesla with 100% natural energy by altering its charge
      rate, not drawing any power from the main grid whatsoever.
