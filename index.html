      <h1>About me</h1>
      I'm currently based in Perth 🇦🇺 where I work as a Solutions Architect at
      <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>. Previously I studied Computer
      Science and Data Science at <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au">UWA</a>,
      until I earnt my BSc in 2024. I spend my spare time working on various
      side projects, including some attempts at bootstrapping startups.

      My main hobby is playing chess - if you are interested feel free to check
      out my
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/stats/live/rapid/charles">current rating</a
      >. I am entirely self taught. My chess.com username is just
      <code>charles</code>, which is nice to have. Another of my hobbies is
      Clash Royale (I've pushed up to the top 100 players in 🇦🇺 before). I
      also have my dog Boris who is pictured above, although I'm not sure if
      having a dog counts as a hobby.

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>
        I build tools to solve problems I run into often enough that it's
        easier to build a solution than keep dealing with them manually. I've
        recently also been inspired by Pieter Levels to try to find a niche in
        the market and build something useful around it. While it is hard to
        find time outside of work for these, I do try to keep busy.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h2>
          <a href="https://quanttrading.io">quanttrading.io</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          I'm the technical cofounder, building a quant trading interview prep
          and practice site. It's focused on decision-making, desk-style drills,
          and structured prep rather than just textbook formulas. It gives
          candidates a concrete way to practice and track progress before
          interviews.

        <h2>
          <a href="https://mentionsignal.com">mentionsignal.com</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          A platform for performing research on Polymarket mention markets. It
          takes a market URL, lets users connect the sources that matter, and
          shows how often each traded term appears across coverage,
          transcripts, PDFs, and other text sources. It lets traders make
          statistically informed bets instead of simply going off vibes.

        <h2>
          <a href="https://counterparty.markets">counterparty.markets</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          A Polymarket analysis tool that looks at the top whales on each side
          of any market, and shows whether they are long-term winners or
          losers, their P/L, and other info. The goal is to help traders make
          informed bets and avoid betting against people with a strong record
          of success.

        <h2>
          <a href="https://statusmapper.app">statusmapper.app</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          A Qantas Status Credits calculator for partner airline flights. It
          maps fare classes and routes (with mileage band fallback), and
          supports all 22 partners whether they're <strong>one</strong>world
          partners that earn status or basic partners that only earn points.
        </p>
        <p>
          I built it because partner earn rates were unclear and I got tired
          of checking the partner earn tables manually every time. It also
          helps flyers avoid tricky situations where they book a
          <strong>one</strong>world partner flight expecting to earn status
          credits, but find after flying that they booked an ineligible fare
          class to do so.

        <h2>This website</h2>
        <code>It looks like this on purpose.</code>
        <p>
          A pet project that I return to every so often to tweak. It started
          as a learning experience, but now I keep it around because it's mine
          and I like it. And in the age of (frankly) slop taking over the
          internet, I have resolved to keep my personal site, which is a
          reflection of
          myself, refreshingly simple.

        <h2>ipster</h2>
        <p>
          A CLI app that stores IP addresses and generates SSH commands to
          speed up my workflow. It stores an IP, user login, and optionally a
          key location, then generates the SSH command and writes it to the
          user's clipboard. Built with
          <a href="https://github.com/spf13/cobra">cobra</a> on top of Golang.
