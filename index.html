      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      My main hobby is playing chess - if you are interested feel free to check
      out my chesscom
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/insights/charles#overview">insights</a>
      or my
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/stats/live/rapid/charles">current rating</a
      >. Outside of chess I spend my time reading, travelling (when I can), and
      hanging out with my dog Boris. I also really like coffee ☕️.

        <h2>This website!</h2>
        I am especially proud of this site as it's something that I put lots of
        effort into. It loads super fast despite being hosted on a single server
        in Singapore 🇸🇬, since the page size itself is tiny. It's even sent over
        an encrypted connection - something that took me quite a while to figure
        out. Check out that 🔒 HTTPS icon in your browser! Plus I learnt all the
        ins and outs that come with manually setting up webhosting on a linux
        server, which is why I left a little note about it at the bottom of the
        page.
        <h3>Site specs:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Hosted on a t4g instance, free till 31/12/2023</li>
          <li>Served using Apache HTTPD</li>
          <li>HTTPS enabled</li>
          <li>Written in HTML and CSS</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>A greener EV (Upcoming)</h2>
      By monitoring how much electricity a solar panel system generates, I aim
      to be able to dynamically change the charge rate of a linked electric
      vehicle in order to charge via 100% natural energy, regularly altering its
      charging rate in order to not draw any power from the main grid. The
      benefits of this include the direct cost savings via reduced main
      electricity grid usage, and indirectly a lower carbon footprint on the
      environment via consumption of purely "green" electricity.
