      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      My main hobby is playing chess - if you are interested feel free to check
      out my chesscom
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/insights/charles#overview">insights</a>
      or my
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/stats/live/rapid/charles">current rating</a
      >. Outside of chess I spend my time reading, listening to music,
      travelling (when I can), and hanging out with my dog Boris, pictured
      above. I also like coffee ‚òïÔ∏è.

        <h2>This website!</h2>
        <p>
          I am especially proud of this site as it's something that I put lots
          of effort into - especially making it mobile friendly. Keeping it
          small and simple was one of my main priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had previously set up the hosting for this website the hard way,
          using an EC2 instance based in Singapore üá∏üá¨ which I manually
          configured with
          <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">HTTPD</a>, renewing the SSL
          certificate myself manually in order to enable HTTPS. Fun stuff! I
          leant a lot setting that up, however I have since changed the hosting
          solution to a more simple deployment with less maintainance required.
        </p>
        <h3>Site specs:</h3>
        <p>
          This site is hosted on
          <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/"> Cloudflare</a>, which is
          a CDN (Content Delivery Network) that enables fast load times by
          caching this sites data in various locations around the world. More
          about Cloudflare:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Highly available, the Cloudflare network can reach 95% of the worlds
            population within approximately 50 ms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Encrypted over SSL by default with no configuration required,
            Cloudflare enables HTTPS without me needing to manage any
            certificates.
          </li>
          <li>
            Completely 100% free! Cloudflare has a free tier that is perfect for
            simple static sites like this. The primary cost of running this page
            is the yearly ~$10 cost for the domain.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The site itself is written in pure HTML and CSS, and was designed to
          be light and minimal. If you want to take a look at the raw HTML
          yourself, the site is publicly available on my github
          <a href="https://github.com/charlesdevelops/dotcom"> here</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Other upcoming projects</h2>
      I have a ton of ideas I'm looking to work on over the course of the year
      in my free time, with some smaller projects already on my github. I'll
      update this site as I work on them!
